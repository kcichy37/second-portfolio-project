# TicTacToe
## Purpose of the project
The purpose of this project is to showcase the functionality of JavaScript in a website, this is done by creating a small scale TicTacToe game for usersâ€™ to play against each other. The game is able to track the players' placements on the board to identify the winner between X and O as well as is able to keep score for the players and declare which player has won or if it is a tie. 

As TicTacToe is a simple and easy game, the purpose of it needs to be that it is simple in use and navigation for users to play the game.

## Features
The game has 4 sections:
- Section with Game rules
- Section with the Game board
- Section with Scores
